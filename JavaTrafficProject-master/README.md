# Java Traffic Project
This repository contains a series of small programs that must be opend within the Eclipse IDE or an equivalent. There are 2 programmes so far, the traffic solution solved in class and a programme that that takes in different numbers and adds them.

#Note
This repo contains only .class files (located in the bin folder ) and therefore is required to be opened in Eclipse or an equivalent IDE.

This was done by [Osuka Andala](https://github.com/Osuka-Andala),  [Martin  Nganga](https://github.com/mtnjoroge) and I.
